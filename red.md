# Antigravity

> A paid, execution-locked productivity system that eliminates choice, excuses, and drift.

Antigravity is **not a habit tracker** and **not a motivational app**.  
It is a **time-boxed execution contract** where users *define their own obligations*, temporarily surrender flexibility, and are penalized for non-compliance.

This system is designed for:
- Competitive exam aspirants
- Founders and builders
- High-agency individuals who want results, not reminders

---

## 🚨 Core Principle

**Discipline does not scale with freedom.  
Execution scales with constraint.**

Antigravity enforces execution by:
- Removing daily decision-making
- Locking access after repeated failure
- Requiring *paid re-entry* to resume

No streaks.  
No motivational quotes.  
No second chances by default.

## 🧠 What This Product Is (One Line)

> A self-authored execution lock where users define what must be done, lose access on failure, and regain it only through deliberate re-entry.

---

## 🔒 How It Works (System Flow)

### 1. User-Defined Obligation
- User manually types:
  - Syllabus
  - Tasks
  - Study blocks
  - Duration (7 / 14 / 30 days)
- No templates by default
- Ownership is enforced at input level

---

### 2. Execution Lock
- Once started:
  - Tasks cannot be edited
  - Schedule cannot be softened
  - Scope cannot be reduced
- The system treats the plan as **immutable**

---

### 3. Daily Verification
- Completion is verified via:
  - Manual proof (check + friction)
  - Optional evidence (notes, screenshots, logs)
- Missed tasks are recorded, not forgiven

---

### 4. Failure Threshold
- After **N failures** (configurable):
  - App access is locked
  - No planning, no tracking, no edits
- User is shown a failure summary

---

### 5. Paid Re-Entry
- To regain access:
  - User must explicitly re-enter
  - Payment is required
  - Previous data remains read-only
- This creates **loss aversion and seriousness**

---

## 🧩 Multi-Track Support

Antigravity supports parallel execution tracks:
- Multiple exams (e.g., UPSC + Optional)
- Work + Study
- Skill acquisition + primary goal

Each track has:
- Independent failure counters
- Independent locks
- Independent re-entry rules

---

## 🛡 Anti-Gaming Measures

- No task deletion after lock
- No retroactive completion
- No streak recovery hacks
- No “I was busy” bypasses
- Optional cooldown period after lock

This system assumes **users will try to cheat** — and designs against it.

---

## 🧪 Prompt-Controlled AI (Optional Layer)

AI is **not a coach** here.

Its role is limited to:
- Auditing user-defined syllabi
- Detecting vague or underspecified tasks
- Flagging unrealistic daily loads
- Explaining failure patterns post-lock

AI **cannot**:
- Modify plans
- Excuse failures
- Soften constraints

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Indicative)

- Frontend: React / Next.js
- Backend: Supabase / Firebase
- Auth: Email + OTP
- Payments: Razorpay / Stripe
- State Enforcement: Server-side rules
- Offline-first where possible

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Execution > Motivation
- Friction is a feature
- Choice reduction beats inspiration
- Consequences must be real
- User autonomy exists **only before commitment**

---

## 🚫 What This Is NOT

- ❌ A habit tracker  
- ❌ A motivational app  
- ❌ A wellness product  
- ❌ A gamified dopamine loop  
- ❌ A planner with reminders  

If users want comfort, this product is not for them.

---

## 📈 Intended Outcomes

- Higher follow-through rates
- Reduced task churn
- Fewer abandoned plans
- Stronger commitment signaling
- Psychological seriousness toward goals

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Antigravity is intentionally strict.  
It is designed for users who **opt into constraint**.

This product may feel uncomfortable by design.
